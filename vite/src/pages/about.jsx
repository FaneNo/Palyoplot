                            <b>Long version:</b> Palyoplot is an R package that adds
                            publication-quality Quaternary science data visualization
                            functions. Palyoplot implements customizable stratigraphical 
                            diagramming of proxy records such as pollen, sedimentary 
                            charcoal, and diatoms, and is appropriate for routine and 
                            scientific research use. It includes the ability to create 
                            standard stratigraphic plot by taxa, stacked taxa plots, and 
                            appending multiple plots to create one larger plot

                            R code automates the process and does the heavy lifting for. Contrain your data based on
                            your period of interest without having to edit files. Automtically extrapo- late and assign
                            your age model to your data. Dynamically convert your counts to percentages, and exclude
                            from drawing taxa that donâ€™t meet a minimum threshold. Exclude entire groups from being
                            drawn (sub-setting your data). Ensure consistency in the order your data displays.

                            No more constantly having to adjust set- tings in software dialog boxes to get the 
                            look-and-feel you want! Maintain consis- tency of design between various studies and 
                            publications. Quickly and easily alter graphics for print vs presentations (font sizes, 
                            typeface, b/w vs. color, etc).

                            Awwâ€¦ *blush* thanks for asking! Iâ€™m Anna, an Assistant Professor

                            (and the owner of this site). This package was born from 
                            frustration of dealing with software and workflow issues during 
                            my dissertation at the University of Nevada Reno (Go Wolfpack!), 
                            and wanting to simplify the process (itâ€™s always the side 
                            projects that end up most useful, isnâ€™t it?). I actually 
                            developed an entire workflow and database setup that synergizes 
                            with this package, if youâ€™re interested.
